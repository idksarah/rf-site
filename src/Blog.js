            <CardHorizontal title="Tinker CAD Workshop with CodeForFun" content="We had an incredible time hosting a CAD workshop in collaboration with our nonprofit partner, Code for Fun, where kids got to learn CAD in a fun, winter-themed setting! The workshop was designed to introduce children to the world of 3D design, using winter-themed projects like creating Star Trees and Snowmen. The older kids (3rd to 6th grade) dove into more detailed designs, while the younger group (5 to 8 years old) enjoyed the Snowman activity and had the chance to explore their own creative ideas. It was amazing to see the kids so engaged and excited about learning CAD, and weâ€™re thrilled that we were invited back for the next class!" img={tinkercad1}></CardHorizontal>
